# MCP Server for Home Assistant (HTTP Transport)

A Home Assistant Custom Component that provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using **HTTP transport**, allowing AI assistants like Claude to interact with your Home Assistant instance.

**Why HTTP transport with OAuth?** This project was built primarily to support MCP Streamable HTTP transport, enabling web-based clients like Claude that require OIDC and OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591). Since Home Assistant already has an [official MCP integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/) that supports SSE transport, there wasn't a need to duplicate that. For local or custom client setups, Long-Lived Access Token authentication can be enabled as an alternative.

## Features

- 🌐 **HTTP transport** (not SSE) - works remotely, not just locally
- 🔐 **OAuth 2.0 authentication** with Dynamic Client Registration (via [hass-oidc-server](https://github.com/ganhammar/hass-oidc-server))
- 🔑 **Long-Lived Access Token** authentication (opt-in) for local and custom client setups
- 🏠 Full Home Assistant API access (entities, services, areas, devices, history, statistics)
- 🔧 Easy HACS installation
- 📝 CRUD management of automations, scenes, scripts, and helper entities (input_boolean, counter, timer, schedule, and more)
- 📋 Lovelace dashboard management (list, get/save/delete config, create/update/delete dashboards)
- 🩺 System administration tools (error log, config validation, restart, system status)
- 📁 YAML config file management — read, write, delete files with automatic backup before every change and built-in config validation (opt-in)
- 📷 Camera & image access — capture live camera frames and read saved image files for visual analysis (opt-in)
- 📊 Resources, prompts, and completions for richer AI interactions
- 🧹 Optimization prompts for auditing automations, naming conventions, and scheduling

## Prerequisites

The integration supports two authentication methods:

- **OAuth 2.0** (default): Required for browser-based clients like Claude. Requires [hass-oidc-server](https://github.com/ganhammar/hass-oidc-server) to be installed and configured.
- **Long-Lived Access Tokens** (opt-in): For local agents and custom MCP clients that can't run an OAuth browser flow. No extra dependencies. Must be enabled in the integration settings.

You can use both methods at the same time. When both are active, the server tries OAuth first and falls back to the Long-Lived Access Token.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
1. Search for "MCP Server"
1. Click "Download"
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. Configure the integration (see Configuration section below)

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/mcp_server_http_transport` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. Configure the integration (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
1. Click "Add Integration"
1. Search for "MCP Server"
1. Choose your authentication method:
   - Leave "Enable native Home Assistant authentication" **unchecked** for OAuth-only (requires [hass-oidc-server](https://github.com/ganhammar/hass-oidc-server))
   - **Check** it to allow Long-Lived Access Tokens (can be used alongside OAuth or on its own)

You can change this setting later via Settings > Devices & Services > MCP Server > Configure.

## Usage with Claude in Browser (OAuth)

This requires the [hass-oidc-server](https://github.com/ganhammar/hass-oidc-server) integration to be installed.

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), which allows Claude to automatically register itself without manual client setup.

1. In Claude (claude.ai):
   - Open Profile (bottom left corner)
   - Click Settings (gear icon)
   - Navigate to "Connectors"
   - Click "Add custom connector"
   - Enter your MCP server URL: `https://your-home-assistant.com/api/mcp`
   - Click "Connect"

2. Claude will automatically:
   - Discover your Home Assistant's OAuth endpoints
   - Register itself as an OAuth client
   - Redirect you to Home Assistant for authentication
   - Request access to your Home Assistant data

3. In Home Assistant:
   - Log in if not already authenticated
   - Review the permissions requested by Claude
   - Click "Authorize" to grant access

That's it! Claude will now be able to interact with your Home Assistant instance through the MCP server.

## Usage with Long-Lived Access Tokens

For local agents or MCP clients that can't run an OAuth browser flow, you can authenticate with a Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token. This must be enabled first.

1. Enable native authentication: Settings > Devices & Services > MCP Server > Configure > check "Enable native Home Assistant authentication"
2. Create a token: go to your Home Assistant user profile > Long-Lived Access Tokens > Create Token
3. Configure your MCP client to send the token as a Bearer header to `http://your-home-assistant:8123/api/mcp`

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I list all automations, scenes, or scripts?</summary>

Use the dedicated list tools to get full configurations:

```
list_automations()   // all automations with triggers, conditions, actions
list_scenes()        // all scenes with entity states
list_scripts()       // all scripts with sequences
```

To get the configuration of a single item:

```
get_automation_config(automation_id="abc-123")
get_scene_config(scene_id="def-456")
get_script_config(key="morning_routine")
```

You can also use `list_entities(domain="automation")` to get entity states, but the tools above return the full YAML configuration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I create an automation?</summary>

Use `create_automation` with a standard HA automation config:

```json
create_automation(config={
  "alias": "Turn on lights at sunset",
  "trigger": [{"platform": "sun", "event": "sunset"}],
  "action": [{"service": "light.turn_on", "target": {"entity_id": "light.living_room"}}]
})
```

The same pattern applies to scenes and scripts. Scripts use a `key` parameter instead of an auto-generated ID:

```json
create_script(key="morning_routine", config={
  "alias": "Morning Routine",
  "sequence": [{"service": "light.turn_on", "target": {"entity_id": "light.bedroom"}}]
})
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I call a service like turning on a light?</summary>

Use `call_service` with the domain, service, and optionally an entity and extra data:

```json
call_service(domain="light", service="turn_on", entity_id="light.living_room", data={"brightness": 200})
```

To discover what services are available:

```
list_services()                    // all services
list_services(domain="light")      // just light services
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I manage Lovelace dashboards?</summary>

Use `list_dashboards` to see all dashboards, then `get_dashboard_config` and `save_dashboard_config` to read and modify their content. Use `url_path="default"` for the main Overview dashboard:

```json
get_dashboard_config(url_path="default")
save_dashboard_config(url_path="default", config={"views": [{"title": "Home", "cards": [...]}]})
```

To create or delete dashboards themselves, use the experimental `create_dashboard` and `delete_dashboard` tools. These use internal HA APIs and may break with future HA updates.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I manage helper entities (input_boolean, counter, timer, etc.)?</summary>

Use `list_helpers` to see all helpers, optionally filtered by type:

```
list_helpers()                          // all helper types
list_helpers(domain="input_boolean")    // only toggles
```

To create a helper, specify the domain and a config with at least a `name`:

```json
create_helper(domain="input_boolean", config={"name": "Vacation Mode", "icon": "mdi:palm-tree"})
create_helper(domain="input_number", config={"name": "Target Temperature", "min": 15, "max": 30, "step": 0.5, "unit_of_measurement": "°C"})
create_helper(domain="input_select", config={"name": "House Mode", "options": ["Home", "Away", "Sleep"]})
create_helper(domain="counter", config={"name": "Motion Events", "initial": 0, "step": 1})
create_helper(domain="timer", config={"name": "Cooking Timer", "duration": "00:30:00"})
```

To update or delete, use the entity ID:

```json
update_helper(entity_id="input_boolean.vacation_mode", config={"name": "Vacation Mode", "icon": "mdi:airplane"})
delete_helper(entity_id="counter.motion_events")
```

> **Note:** These tools only manage UI-created helpers stored in Home Assistant's `.storage/` files. Helpers defined in YAML configuration are read-only from the perspective of these tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I read or edit YAML configuration files?</summary>

Use `list_config_files` to see all editable YAML files, then `get_config_file` and `save_config_file` to read and modify them:

```
list_config_files()
get_config_file(filename="automations.yaml")
save_config_file(filename="automations.yaml", content="...")
```

`save_config_file` automatically runs a full Home Assistant config validation after every save and reports any errors inline. Pass `run_check: false` to skip this.

To remove a custom file:

```
delete_config_file(filename="my_custom.yaml")
```

When editing multiple files in one session use `batch_edit_config_files` instead — it creates one backup snapshot before all changes and runs one config check at the end:

```
batch_edit_config_files(
    saves=[
        {"filename": "templates.yaml", "content": "..."},
        {"filename": "sensors.yaml",   "content": "..."},
    ],
    deletes=["binary_sensor.yaml", "old_lights.yaml"],
)
```

Both `saves` and `deletes` are optional — you can use either or both in the same call.

> **Note:** Only first-level `.yaml`/`.yml` files in the config directory are accessible. Subdirectories and non-YAML files are blocked. The following files are also blocked from direct edits — use the dedicated tools instead:
>
> - **`secrets.yaml`** — never readable, contains credentials
> - **`automations.yaml`**, **`scenes.yaml`**, **`scripts.yaml`** — owned by Home Assistant's storage layer; use `create_automation` / `update_automation` / `delete_automation` (and the equivalents for scenes and scripts) so UI-managed entries stay consistent. These files are still included in backups, so a restore never drops them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I let the AI see a camera or analyze an image?</summary>

Camera and image access are disabled by default. Enable them per capability via Settings → Devices & Services → MCP Server → Configure: "Enable camera image access" for live camera frames, and "Enable image file access" for reading saved image files.

To analyze what a camera sees right now, capture the current frame directly — no snapshot file is needed:

```
get_camera_image(entity_id="camera.front_door")
get_camera_image(entity_id="camera.front_door", width=1024)
```

To analyze a snapshot already saved to disk (for example by the `camera.snapshot` service), read it back by path:

```
get_image_file(path="www/snapshots/front_door.jpg")
get_image_file(path="/config/www/snapshots/front_door.jpg")
```

The image is returned directly to the model for analysis. `get_image_file` supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP, and can only read from directories Home Assistant is allowed to access (the config directory and configured media dirs) — the same allowlist that governs where `camera.snapshot` can write.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the automatic backup work?</summary>

Every call to `save_config_file` and `delete_config_file` automatically creates a full snapshot of all first-level YAML files (excluding `secrets.yaml`) before making any change. When using `batch_edit_config_files`, only one backup is created for the entire batch — regardless of how many files are saved or deleted. Snapshots are stored in:

```
config/mcp_backups/2026-04-26_14-30-00-123456/
```

The backup path is included in the tool response so you always know where to look. You never need to remember to back up manually before an edit — it happens every time.

To create an additional manual snapshot before a larger operation:

```
backup_config_files()
```

To see all available snapshots:

```
list_config_backups()
```

To restore the latest snapshot (or a specific one by timestamp):

```
restore_config_backup()
restore_config_backup(timestamp="2026-04-26_14-30-00-123456")
```

`restore_config_backup` only overwrites files present in the backup — files created after the snapshot are left untouched. Before any files are overwritten it creates a **pre-restore snapshot** of the current state, so you can always roll back from a restore (the snapshot path is included in the response). A config check runs automatically after restoring.

> **If Home Assistant fails to start** after a bad edit: backup files are always accessible at `config/mcp_backups/<timestamp>/` and can be copied back manually via the filesystem or SSH.

**Restoring a single file:** `restore_config_backup` always restores all files from a snapshot at once — there is no tool to restore a single file. If you only need one file back, either restore the full snapshot and re-apply your other changes, or copy the file manually from `config/mcp_backups/<timestamp>/<filename>` via SSH, Samba, or the File Editor add-on.

**Cleaning up old backups:** Snapshots accumulate with every edit. Use `cleanup_config_backups` to remove old ones:

```
cleanup_config_backups()                    // delete backups older than 30 days (default)
cleanup_config_backups(older_than_days=7)   // delete backups older than 7 days
```

You can also delete entries from `config/mcp_backups/` manually via SSH, the Samba share, or the File Editor add-on.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does "experimental" mean for some tools?</summary>

Some tools use internal Home Assistant APIs that are not publicly exposed and may break with future HA updates.

**Dashboard tools:** `create_dashboard`, `update_dashboard`, and `delete_dashboard` use `DashboardsCollection` and replicate side effects (panel registration, dashboards dict updates) that HA normally handles internally. The config-level tools (`list_dashboards`, `get/save/delete_dashboard_config`) use stable public APIs and are not experimental.

**Helper tools:** `get_helper_config`, `create_helper`, `update_helper`, and `delete_helper` use `StorageCollection` internals to manage UI-created helpers. They only affect helpers stored in `.storage/` — helpers defined in YAML are read-only from the perspective of these tools. `list_helpers` uses public APIs and is not experimental.
